# Apple Code Signing & Notarization
# Copy this file to .env.signing and fill in your values.
# NEVER commit .env.signing — it contains secrets.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program ($99/yr): https://developer.apple.com/programs/
#   2. Create a "Developer ID Application" certificate in Keychain Access
#   3. Find your Team ID at: https://developer.apple.com/account → Membership Details
#   4. Create an app-specific password at: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords
#

# Your signing identity — run this to find it:
#   security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID Application"
# Example: "Developer ID Application: John Doe (ABC123XYZ)"
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: YOUR_NAME (YOUR_TEAM_ID)"

# Your Apple ID email (the one used for Apple Developer Program)
APPLE_ID="your@email.com"

# App-specific password (NOT your Apple ID password)
APPLE_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"

# Your 10-character Team ID from developer.apple.com
APPLE_TEAM_ID="ABC123XYZ"
